# Solr Upgrade Tests
Introduction
------------

The purpose of this program is to test rolling upgrades for Solr Cloud.

Current Test Results

| Upgraded version >> | 5.3.0 | 5.3.1 | 5.3.2 | 5.4.0 | 5.4.1 |
|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 5.2.1               | PASS  | PASS  |       |       |       |
| 5.3.0               |       | PASS  |       | FAIL  | FAIL  |

To Run
------
    
Use the following command to run this program on server

     mvn clean compile assembly:single
     java -jar target/org.apache.solr.tests.upgradetests-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -v1 5.3.0 -v2 5.4.1 -Nodes 3 -Shards 2 -Replicas 3


Program parameters
------------------

      -v1           {Version One}                   Example 5.4.0
      -v2           {Version Two}                   Example 5.4.1
      -Nodes        {Number of nodes}               Example 3
      -Shards       {Number of shards}              Example 2
      -Replicas     {Number of Replicas}            Example 3

Steps
-----

Following is the summary of the steps that the program follows to test the rolling upgrade
    
1. Start ZK
2. Start Solr nodes 
3. Create a Test collection
4. Insert a set of 1000 documents
5. Stop each node one by one, upgrade each node by replacing lib/ folder and webapp/ folder on server and then start each node
6. Check if the /live_nodes has the upgraded node
7. Check if all the documents are available from the collection
8. If 6 and 7 pass, the program identifies the test as successful
9. Upon failure of either 6 or 7, the program declares the test as failed
10. If test passed, shutdown the nodes and cleaning zookeeper data


Todo
----

1. Running against unreleased (master/branch_5x)
2. Making it easier to add more tests to this framework
3. Code cleanup.
4. Have ability to specify any version of SolrJ to be used in the tests. (Currently, this is hardcoded in the pom.xml, which should be easy to change configurably).
